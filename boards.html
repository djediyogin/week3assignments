  <h2> DIGITAL MAKER AND FABRICATION DEGREE OBJECTIVES</h2> 
<h3>1. Using digital and physical tools, engineer and build prototypes that technology patents are then applied for.</h3>
<h3>2. Build physical products while demonstrating technique and safety competency across commonly accepted prototyping
devices, maker tools and techniques.</h3>
<h3>3. Produce products that balance form and function while reflecting current and future trends in design and human factors.</h3>
<h3>4. Demonstrate the ability to evaluate material and build technique options during the creation of products and their
prototypes.</h3>
<h3>5. Demonstrate the ability to effectively implement embedded systems and fundamental electronics into product builds.</h3>
<h3>6. Place prototypes and builds within the Agile and MVP development frameworks.</h3>
